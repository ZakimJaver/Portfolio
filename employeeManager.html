                    <i>Platform: </i>
                        C++

                    This application is designed for business owners who want to manage their employees. 
                    It allows them to add new employees as well as view and edit existing ones. The 
                    Application is directed towards sale companies and allows them to manage a sales team, 
                    they could assign employees to different teams and administer their sales.

                    A singly linked is used to temporarily store and work with the data. A text file is used 
                    for permanent storage.

                    <h4 style="margin-left: 5em;">Operations:</h4>
                    <i>Save data:</i>
                        The data will temporarily be stored in the linked list, once the user is ready to 
                        permanent store the data they would do so using the save function. The data will be
                        saved to a text file. 

                    <i>Load data:</i>
                        The user is able to load saved data from the text file. This would be used when the
                        application is opened to resume from where the user last left off. The data from the 
                        text file will be loaded onto the linked list.

                    <i>Add employee:</i>
                        This will allow the user to add a new employee to the linked list. A unique Employee
                        ID will be generated automatically for every employee. The user would have to add the
                        following information about the new employee: first name, last name, group id, date of
                        birth, date joined, phone number and email address. 

                    <i>Edit/View Employee:</i>
                        This will prompt the user to enter the ID of the employee they wish to edit/view. 
                        Once entered, all the data of that employee will be desplayed. The user would be able
                        to add sales, edit any information of that employee as well as delete the employee 
                        from the list.
                         
                    <i>List all employees:</i>
                        This will list the employee ID, employees full name, total sales and group ID of all 
                        the employees in the linked list.
