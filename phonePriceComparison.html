                    This is a C++ application that compares two different phone plans and finds which plan 
                    is better for most customers. All of the data (such as customer name, call duration…) 
                    is generated randomly. There are two types of plans, regular and premium. The difference 
                    between them is how the balance is calculated:

                    Computing a Regular Customer’s balance: 
                    balance = monthlyfee + percall × num_calls
                    where monthly fee is $5, a per call rate is $1. 

                    Computing a Premium Customer’s balance: 
                    balance = monthlyfee + permin × num_mins
                    where monthly fee is $30, a per minute rate is $0.05.
                    Calls are always rounded up to the next min. I.e. 1 second call is rounded to 1 minute. 

                    Example of the output:
                    Simulation run: 
                    ---------------
                    Regular Customers:

                            Number of customers in the group: 356
                            Average number of calls/per customer: 154
                            Average duration of the call/per customer: 60 mins
                            Average balance/per customer: $159.28
                            Customer with largest balance: Ybhp Awyx ($304.00)
                            Customer with smallest balance: Cfsbh Fjxsx ($15.00)

                    Premium Customers:

                            Number of customers in the group: 359
                            Average number of calls/per customer: 147
                            Average duration of the call/per customer: 60 mins
                            Average balance/per customer: $470.71
                            Customer with largest balance: Ljfqp Hqrhm ($960.20)
                            Customer with smallest balance: Gvvuyh Urash ($60.35)

                    Regular customers on average save $311.43 compared to Premium customers.
